Theme file is called USRPFP-PERSONAL.theme.css

Put that in your theme's folder and there you go!

If PFP doesn't apply, either Discord has updated or your User ID is different.

===========================================================================

import.css file is the entire database **EXCEPT** my User ID. Meaning I can customize MY profile picture to my liking while others have to go through the USRPFP official server. If you want to customize YOUR User ID, then copy it from Discord and replace mine in the theme.css file.
